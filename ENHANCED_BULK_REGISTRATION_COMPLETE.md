## Overview

The system has been upgraded from a simple invitation system to a complete **Direct Registration System** with automatic account creation and temporary credentials.

## üéØ What Changed

- Freelancers had to complete registration themselves
- Required email verification

### New System (Direct Registration):

- Admin directly creates verified accounts
- System generates temporary passwords
- Automatic email with login credentials
- Forced password change on first login
- Profile becomes active after password change

```

### 2. Direct User Registration

**What Happens When Excel is Uploaded:**

1. **Account Creation:**

   - Creates verified User account (role: freelancer)
   - Generates secure 12-character temporary password
   - Sets `isVerified: true` (admin-created accounts are pre-verified)
   - Sets `requirePasswordChange: true`
   - Sets `firstLogin: true`

2. **Profile Creation:**

   - Automatically creates Profile with:
     - Skills array (parsed from comma-separated list)

**Password Generation:**

- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Cryptographically random
- Stored temporarily for admin reference

**Example Password:** `aB3$kL9@mN2*`

### 4. Enhanced User Flow

**First Login Experience:**

1. User receives email with temporary password
2. User logs in with email and temporary password

6. After password change:

   - Profile becomes fully active
