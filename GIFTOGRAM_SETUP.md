# Giftogram Integration Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Fix for Gift Card Integration

### Problem
Your gift card orders are being created successfully in Giftogram, but your backend was using **mock data** instead of the **real API responses**.

### Solution
The backend has been updated to use the real Giftogram API. Follow these steps:

## 📋 Steps to Enable Real API Integration

### 1. Create/Update Backend Environment File

Create a `.env` file in your `backend/` directory with these settings:

```bash
# Copy from env.example and add:
GIFTOGRAM_API_KEY=00329cca-f8eb-4b7a-b1eb-8f3f746ad840-NjI
GIFTOGRAM_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```

### 2. Restart Your Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
# or
node server.js
```

### 3. Test the Integration

Now when you create a gift card withdrawal:
- ✅ Real API calls will be made to Giftogram
- ✅ Real order data will be returned (not mock data)
- ✅ Orders will appear in your Giftogram dashboard
- ✅ Gift cards will be sent to recipients

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Backend Changes:
1. **Removed API Secret Requirement** - Giftogram only needs API key
2. **Updated Credential Validation** - Only checks for valid API key
3. **Fixed Mock Data Fallback** - Now uses real API when credentials are valid

### Frontend Changes:
1. **Simplified Gift Card Modal** - Removed campaign selection
2. **Auto-populated User Data** - Uses logged-in user's email/name
3. **Fixed Campaign ID** - Uses your specific campaign ID
4. **Unique Transaction IDs** - Generates unique external_id and reference_number

## 📊 Expected Results

After this fix:

**Before (Mock Data):**
```json
{
  "campaignName": "Unknown Gift Card",
  "id": "mock-order-1234567890"
}
```

**After (Real API Data):**
```json
{
  "campaign_name": "aniket17",
  "order_id": "4b2074bf-e043-47c5-a512-1244d46aeca2",
  "external_id": "order-20250620-003",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

## 🎯 Verification

1. **Check Backend Logs** - Should see "Making API call to Giftogram" instead of "using mock data"
2. **Check Giftogram Dashboard** - New orders should appear immediately
3. **Check Email** - Gift cards should be sent to recipient emails
4. **Check Response Data** - Should match your Postman test results

## 🚨 Important Notes

- The API key `00329cca-f8eb-4b7a-b1eb-8f3f746ad840-NjI` is for **sandbox testing**
- Gift cards created in sandbox are **not real** and have no monetary value
- For production, you'll need a production API key from Giftogram

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you still see mock data:
1. Check if `.env` file exists in `backend/` directory
2. Verify `GIFTOGRAM_API_KEY` is set correctly
3. Restart the backend server
4. Check backend console logs for "API credentials not configured" warnings
