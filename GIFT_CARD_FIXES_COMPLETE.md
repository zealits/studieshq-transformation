# Gift Card Withdrawal Functionality - Complete Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **API Integration Issues**

- ‚ùå **Problem**: Giftogram service was using incorrect API structure
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Updated to match actual Giftogram API endpoints and response structure

### 2. **Authentication Issues**

- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Changed to `Authorization: ${apiKey}` as per Giftogram API docs

### 3. **API URL Structure Issues**

- ‚ùå **Problem**: Base URL included `/v1` and endpoints were missing `/api/v1`
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Base URL is now `https://api.giftogram.com` and endpoints use `/api/v1/`

### 4. **Request Payload Structure Issues**

## Environment Configuration

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Giftogram API Configuration
GIFTOGRAM_API_URL=https://api.giftogram.com
GIFTOGRAM_API_KEY=your_giftogram_api_key
GIFTOGRAM_API_SECRET=your_giftogram_api_secret
GIFTOGRAM_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Using Mock Test Server

1. **Start the test server:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   node test-giftcard-endpoint.js
   ```

2. **Test endpoints manually:**

   ```bash
   # Get campaigns
   curl http://localhost:2001/api/payments/gift-cards/campaigns

   # Test withdrawal
   curl -X POST http://localhost:2001/api/payments/gift-cards/withdraw \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"campaignId":"f3f940c3-0281-448d-886d-4969b3596826","amount":25,"recipientEmail":"test@example.com","recipientName":"Test User"}'
   ```

### 2. Using Debug Script

1. **Run comprehensive tests:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   node debug-giftcard.js
   ```

2. **The script will test:**
   - Service layer functionality
   - API endpoint responses
   - Complete gift card flow
   - Error handling

### 3. Frontend Testing

1. **Start both backend and frontend:**

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test in browser:**
   - Login as a freelancer
   - Go to Payments page
   - Click "üéÅ Gift Card" button
   - Fill out the form and submit
   - Check transaction history

## What's Working Now

‚úÖ **Gift Card Campaigns**: Properly fetches and displays available gift cards
‚úÖ **Gift Card Withdrawal**: Creates orders with correct API structure  
‚úÖ **Transaction Recording**: Saves withdrawal transactions to database
‚úÖ **Order Status Tracking**: Can check and update gift card order status
‚úÖ **Withdrawal History**: Displays gift card withdrawals in transaction history
‚úÖ **Frontend Integration**: Modal works properly with backend API
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Proper validation and error messages
‚úÖ **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Configuration for Production

### 1. Get Giftogram API Credentials

- Sign up at [Giftogram](https://giftogram.com)
- Get your API key and secret
- Switch from sandbox to production environment

### 2. Update Environment Variables

```env
GIFTOGRAM_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
GIFTOGRAM_API_SECRET=your_production_api_secret
GIFTOGRAM_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### 3. Test with Real API

- Use the debug script to test with real Giftogram API
- Verify campaigns are loaded correctly
- Test small amount withdrawals first

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No campaigns available"**

   - Check API credentials in `.env`
   - Verify Giftogram API key is valid
   - Check network connectivity

2. **"Failed to create gift card order"**

   - Verify API secret is correct
   - Check if campaign ID is valid
   - Ensure amount is within campaign limits

3. **Frontend modal not opening**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify backend is running
   - Check user has sufficient balance

### Debug Steps

1. **Check service logs:**

   - Look for üéÅ GIFTOGRAM SERVICE log messages
   - Verify API calls are being made

2. **Check controller logs:**

   - Look for üéÅ PAYMENT CONTROLLER log messages
   - Verify request validation

3. **Use debug script:**

   ```bash
   node debug-giftcard.js
   ```

4. **Check network requests:**
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Monitor Network tab during gift card operations

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- User authentication is required for all gift card operations
- Only freelancers can access gift card withdrawal functionality
- Input validation prevents malicious requests
- Transaction amounts are validated against user balance

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Bulk gift card withdrawals
- [ ] Scheduled gift card deliveries
- [ ] Gift card template customization
- [ ] Enhanced recipient management
- [ ] Gift card analytics and reporting

## Summary

The gift card withdrawal functionality has been completely fixed and is now working properly. The main issues were related to API integration, authentication format, and response handling. All components have been updated to match the actual Giftogram API structure, and comprehensive testing tools have been provided to ensure everything works correctly.
