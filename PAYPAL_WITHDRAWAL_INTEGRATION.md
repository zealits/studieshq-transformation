## How It Works

### Withdrawal Process

1. **User Initiation**: Freelancer clicks "üí∞ PayPal" button in dashboard
2. **Amount Entry**: User enters withdrawal amount (minimum $1.00)
3. **Fee Calculation**: System shows 1% platform fee and net amount
4. **Validation**: System validates amount against available balance
5. **PayPal Payout**: Backend creates PayPal payout to user's registered email
6. **Transaction Recording**: System records transaction in database
7. **Balance Update**: User's wallet balance is updated
8. **Notification**: User receives confirmation and PayPal processes payment

### Fee Structure

- **Platform Fee**: 1% of withdrawal amount
- **Minimum Withdrawal**: $1.00
- **Maximum Withdrawal**: $10,000.00 per transaction
- **Email Requirement**: Valid PayPal email in user profile

## Security & Validation

- **Authentication**: Only authenticated freelancers can withdraw
- **Balance Validation**: Ensures sufficient funds before processing
- **Email Validation**: Requires valid email in user profile
- **Transaction Integrity**: Uses MongoDB sessions for data consistency
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Environment Variables Required
